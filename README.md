### Email Sender App

This is a basic backend application in Node.js that allows sending emails through a POST request. It uses Nodemailer to manage the sending of emails through an SMTP server, according to the user's configuration. 

The operation of sending emails will depend on the SMTP service that is configured (such as Gmail, Outlook, etc.). Some mail providers may require special configurations, such as enabling access to non-secure applications or using OAuth2.
